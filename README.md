## Project Rationale

Pomodle, a fusion of Pomodoro timer and idle game, was designed to revolutionize the way we approach productivity. The project's core inspiration stems from the need to make staying focused and motivated an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

  

### Key Project Goals:

-  **Gamifying Productivity:** The primary objective is to create an engaging platform that leverages the psychological aspects of gameplay to boost user productivity, making it easier to stay on task and achieve goals.

-  **Enhancing User Experience:** By incorporating features such as a customizable task name, task history, and a relaxing music player with self-made lofi songs, Pomodle aims to create a distraction-free environment that helps users stay engaged and motivated.

-  **Providing a Fun Incentive:** The item shop feature adds a fun layer of reward and accomplishment, giving users a sense of achievement as they complete tasks and unlock new items.

  

### Target Audience:

The target audience for the Local Bar website comprises:

-  **Students and Academics:** Individuals seeking to optimize their study habits, manage assignments, and stay focused during long study sessions.

-  **Professionals and Entrepreneurs:** Busy individuals looking to enhance their productivity, prioritize tasks, and stay motivated in fast-paced work environments.

-  **Creative Minds and Hobbyists:** Artists, writers, and creatives who need a tool to help them stay engaged and inspired during long periods of focused work.

  

By catering to the needs of these groups, Pomodle aims to become an indispensable productivity companion, helping users achieve their goals while making the experience enjoyable and rewarding.

  

## UX

Wireframes were meticulously crafted using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), leveraging its versatile design capabilities and collaborative features.

  

The color palette was thoughtfully created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), to create a calming and focused atmosphere, perfect for productivity. The modern color palette was thoughtfully selected to evoke a sense of serenity and motivation. The typography and layout were designed to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, ensuring that users can stay focused on their tasks without distraction.

  

### Wireframes

  

Wireframes played a crucial role in the development of Pomodle, providing a visual guide for the layout and structure of each webpage. They served as blueprints, outlining the placement of key elements such as the login form, Pomodoro timer, shop interface, music player, and task management sections.

  

For Pomodle, wireframes were meticulously crafted to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly interface across all devices. Each wireframe represents a unique page, from the login page to the Pomodoro timer and shop interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Color Palette

![Accessible color palette](assets/docs/ux/colour-palette.png)

For Pomodle, a vibrant and engaging color palette has been carefully selected to evoke the energy and motivation of a productive workspace.

- Dark Gray: #0e1217 The dark gray tone serves as a neutral background, providing a clean and modern foundation for the application. This color choice represents stability and sophistication, setting the tone for a focused and productive environment.

- Purple: #E669FB The vibrant purple hue is used as an accent color, adding a touch of creativity and playfulness to the interface. This color choice inspires motivation and energy, encouraging users to stay engaged and motivated.

- Pink: #fc538d The pink tone is used to add a pop of color and visual interest to the application. This color choice represents enthusiasm and excitement, injecting a sense of fun and enjoyment into the Pomodoro timer experience.

In essence, this color palette reflects the dynamic and engaging nature of Pomodle, where users can stay focused, motivated, and productive in a fun and interactive environment.

  

### Fonts

For Pomodle, I've incorporated Roboto and Poppins fonts sourced from Google Fonts. The font sizes are dynamically adjusted for responsive design.

- Roboto is employed for its clean and modern aesthetic, used for body text and interface elements.

- Poppins is utilized for headings and titles, providing a bold and attention-grabbing contrast to the Roboto font.

Both fonts are imported from Google Fonts, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing typography throughout the application.
